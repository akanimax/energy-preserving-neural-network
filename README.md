-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a data signal propagates through the Neural Network, it is not mandatory that the energy of the signal will be preserved throughout the neural computations.
This research attempts at collecting (perhaps creating) techniques for preserving the Energy throughout the network.

# Model 1: Energy-Delta regularization.
In this model, the neural network is trained by using the energy-delta between any two consecutive layers as the regularization term
